    <h1>University of Florida</h1>
    <p>Upon enrolling at the University of Florida, I have expanded my technical expertise through rigorous coursework in malware analysis, data structures, and microprocessor applications. I have gained hands-on experience with Python, C++, and assembly language, refining my ability to develop software at both high and low levels. My coursework has provided a deep understanding of digital logic, operating systems, and computer architecture, allowing me to analyze how hardware and software interact efficiently.</p>
    <p>Through my studies in malware analysis, I have explored reverse engineering techniques and the behavior of malicious software, deepening my understanding of how malware operates and interacts with systems. My microprocessor applications coursework has further developed my knowledge of embedded systems, teaching me how to program and optimize low-level hardware interactions. Additionally, my experience with data structures and algorithms has refined my problem-solving abilities, preparing me to design efficient and scalable software solutions.</p>
    <p>This academic foundation, combined with hands-on projects and technical challenges, has strengthened my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise, preparing me to pursue a career in software engineering where I can apply my skills to complex and impactful projects.</p>

    <h1>Eastern Florida State College</h1>
    <p>I started dual enrollment at Eastern Florida State College when I entered the 10th grade, allowing me to get an early start on my college education while still in high school. During my time there, I focused on building a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science, taking courses in calculus, and C++ programming. I consistently excelled in my coursework, earning a place on the President's List every semester. In recognition of my academic achievements, I was invited to join the Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society, where I engaged with a community of high-achieving students. Beyond academics, my time at EFSC provided valuable experience in independent learning and time management, as I balanced a full college course load alongside my high school studies. After three years of dedicated work, I graduated with my Associate of Arts degree in May 2023, maintaining a perfect 4.0 GPA.</p>
